<h1>Waiting In Line</h1> <!-- h1 through h5 are headers. The higher the number, the smaller the header -->
<p>This project involved creative brainstorming on modifying the experience of a line to help us rapidly prototype paper methods to let us quickly test the usefulness of the ideas.</p>
<p>My idea was to eliminate the main wait of the line: scanning each item individually. Instead, have a RFID on each product that a store is selling, so that customers just have to scan their credit card, walk through a security gate, and their purchase is done.</p>
